          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

          <p>In the <a href="maps/index.html">Yelp Maps</a> assignment, students
          apply basic machine learning concepts to predict user ratings and
          cluster restaurants around a university campus using
          the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset">Yelp Academic
          Dataset</a>. The assignment primarily illustrates CS1 concepts such as
          data abstraction, sequence processing, and key-value pairs. The
          machine learning ideas are all introduced by the project text as a way
          of motivating course fundamentals. The course itself does not need
          to cover these topics in order for the students to complete the
          project.</p>

          <p>The project builds a single visualization that is developed in
          independent phases. First, restaurants are clustered by location using
          the K-means algorithm. Second, ratings for restaurants (visualized
          using a color scale) are predicted using linear regression (simple
          regression only; no matrix inversions required). Finally, restaurants
          are filtered by search queries. Test cases provided with the project
          ensure that these pieces combine correctly.</p>

          <p>Students don't write the visualization code or need to know how
          to write a web server, but the interactive visualization is rendered
          by a web browser using Python's built-in HTTP server. For students
          interested in web programming, this project allows them to explore
          and extend an example of a browser-based data visualization.

          <h2 id="started">Getting Started</h2>

          <p><a href="maps/index.html">Try the project now by clicking this
          link</a>! If you like it, you can deploy it to your students just by
          giving them <a href="maps/index.html">this link</a> or by hosting the
          contents of <a href="maps_deploy.zip">this zip</a> on your own site.
          If you decide to make changes, please make sure to update the
          contents of <a href="maps/maps.zip">maps.zip</a>, because that's the
          starter package that students use.

          <h2 id="context">Context</h2>

          This project was developed to illustrate the concepts in Sections
          <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/22-data-abstraction.html">2.2</a>,
          <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/23-sequences.html">2.3.1-2.3.5</a>,
          and <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/24-mutable-data.html">2.4.1-2.4.3</a>
          of <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>,
          a free online CS 1 textbook developed for CS 61A at UC Berkeley.

          The project presupposes understanding of functions and expressions.
          We recommend assigning a prior project that reinforces these
          foundational topics, such as the
          <a href="inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/proj/hog">Python version</a>
          of <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2010/neller-pig"> Hog (Nifty Assignments 2010)</a>.
          This project was developed as the second project in a semester-long
          introductory course in which 2/3 of students have prior programming
          experience.

          <h2 id="instructors">Instructor Guide</h2>

          <p>We distribute all unit tests to students, which allows them to
          detect and correct their own errors. We also use this project
          regularly in large courses, so it is common that solutions appear on
          the Internet. Therefore, we recommend that you assign this project as
          an instructional component of your course, rather than an
          assessment. Give students points for completing the assignment
          correctly, but expect that most students will receive all the points.

          <h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

          <p>In our end-of-semester survey, 26% of students rated Yelp Maps as
          their favorite project (second only
          to <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/denero-ants-vs-somebees/">Ants
          vs. Somebees</a>).</p>

          <p>Some sample positive feedback, shamelessly cherry-picked from our
          end-of-semester survey:</p>
          <blockquote>The Yelp Maps project felt like one of the best because it
          was the most polished in terms of how it was presented and the
          design. I really love when the project instructions have lots of
          pictures and diagrams to a larger idea.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>Data analysis projects are great and very applicable to a
          lot of fields. I think there should more emphasis on this for
          projects.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>Yelp Maps brought many advanced topics to a level we could
          understand.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>I loved [Yelp Maps]! It made me feel like I was making
          something that somebody would use.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>I especially like the Yelp Maps project because it is an
          example of a practical application. I am most interested in
          programming apps that have practical daily uses, and this gave me an
          idea of how one might go about programming a complex app.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>Yelp Maps taught me a lot because I think many of the
          confusions regarding [data structures] were solved as a result of the
          project!</blockquote>

          <p>You can see the final
          visualization <a href="maps/visualize/index.html">here</a>. These
          sandwich shop recommendations were generated for a sample user that
          tended to prefer expensive restaurants.</p>

                    learning. This allows them to build an application that is
                    more practical and interesting than would otherwise be
                    possible.</li>
                  <li>Students like the real-world application of analyzing large
                    amounts of data and recommending restaurants to try.</li>
                  <li>The final D3.js visualization of predicted restaurant
                    ratings is interactive, and a cool result to play with.</li>

                    carefully guided through the project. Although this is helpful
                    for most students who don’t know how to start a project from
                    scratch, more advanced students occasionally feel
                    constrained.</li>
                  <li>It is difficult to explain the mathematics behind the
                    algorithms used; some students feel like they are just being
                    told to implement an algorithm.</li>
